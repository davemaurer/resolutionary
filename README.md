##### [Dave Maurer](https://github.com/davemaurer)

Resolutionary is a self-directed project for module 3. The goal is to create a successful web application from a project idea. The app must authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

[Project Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md) | [Heroku](#), while it's up.

### Technical Expectations

You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
You must consume an external API
You must implement a production quality user interface
You must optimize your application optimizing your database, implementing caching, using background workers, and sending AJAX requests
Project Scope

A good project idea should:

Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every checkin
Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
Have enough technical challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a content challenge)
APIs

Your application must make good use of one external dataset or API. Some examples include:


You'll be graded on each of the criteria below with a score of (1) well below expectations, (2) below expectations, (3) as expected, (4) better than expected.
